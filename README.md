# vue-boiler-plate-v-3.3.4

This boiler-plate template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

## Project Setup

Run the script to rename your project:
```sh
npm run rename
```


When you run firebase init or firebase use --add for a project that includes Firebase services, you're generally given the following options:

**1. Use an existing project:** Choose this if you have already created a project in the Firebase console and you want to link your local environment to this project.

**2. Create a new project:** Select this if you want to set up a new project from scratch. This will guide you through creating a new project in the Firebase console directly from the CLI.

**3. Add Firebase to an existing Google Cloud Platform project:** If you have a Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project that doesn't yet use Firebase, you can select this option to add Firebase services to that GCP project.

**4. Don't set up a default project:** This is for when you don't want to link your local code to a Firebase project right away. You might choose this option if you're just testing things out locally or if you're setting up a boilerplate/template that will be linked to a Firebase project later by the user.

Choose in the option number **1**
